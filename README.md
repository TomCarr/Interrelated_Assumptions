# Interrelated Assumptions and Evolutionary Timescales
This repository relates to analyses performed in _The implications of interrelated assumptions on estimates of divergence times and rates of diversification_ (https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syab021), and _The temporal dynamics of evolutionary diversification in Ipomoea_(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106768).

"submission_scripts" were used to perform the simulations in "The implications of interrelated assumptions on estimates of divergence times and rates of diversification". 

"simulation_scripts" will provide a series of user firendly functions for performing simulations.

"three_taxon_time_estimates" is a pipeline for estimating divergence times in large phylogenies with three taxon trees.
