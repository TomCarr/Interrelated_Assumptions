# Interrelated Assumptions and Evolutionary Timescales
This repository relates to the article "The implications of interrelated assumptions on estimates of divergence times and rates of diversification". Further scripts for performing analyses that account for methodological issues highighted in this paper, and in "The temporal dynamics of evolutionary diversification in _Ipomoea_ will be added shortly.

The scripts stored in "simulation_scripts" were used to perform the simulations in the paper.
