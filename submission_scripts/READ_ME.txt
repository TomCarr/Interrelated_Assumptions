These scripts were used to perform the simulation experiments and empirical analyses presented in the manuscript.
R scripts relate to simulations, revbayes scripts relate to parameter estimation, and python scripts were used to format data files between these different environments. 

###SCRIPTS_FOR_SIMULATIONS###

4) "simulate_clock_trees.R" is used to simulate birth death branching processes with constant diversification parameters and constant substitution rates on different branches
	Required inputs are lambda and mu. We performed two different versions. In one lambda = 3 and mu = 0, whilst in the other lambda = 21 and mu = 18.
	Outputs are trees with eithe complete sampling from the branching process, or different levels of taxon sampling, as set out in the manuscript.

5) "simulate_relaxed_clock_trees.R" is the same as above, but with substitution rates for individual branches being drawn from a lognormal distribution.

6) "simulate_diversification_rate_heterogeneity_trees.R" as above, but simulates trees with variable diversification parameters
	Required inputs are therefore a vector of different diversification parameters (for lambda and mu) and a change time for the diversification parameters
	For the simulations relating to divergence times we only varied lambda, for diversification parameters we varied lambda and mu.	

7) "simulate_fossils.R" simulates fossils along the branches of an entire birth death branching process (as simulated with either of the two scripts outlined above).
	Required input is an entire branching process (including extinct branches if they are present)
	Output is a branching process ("tree_with_fossil_tips") with fossil sampling events represented as 0 length branches

8) "extract_fossil_node_simple.R" extracts the oldest fossils for extant clades from "tree_with_fossil_tips" outlined above. 
	Output files are: 
		- "1_r_output_calibration_fossil_ages.txt" = oldest fossil for each extant clade
		- "1_r_output_oldest_fossil_ages.txt" = oldest fossil within tree
		- "1_taxon_sets.txt" a list of the taxa that belong to each clade with a fossil calibration
		- "1_contains_calibrations.txt" a simple file indicating whether the tree containts fossil calibrations

9) "extract_fossil_node_simple_three_taxon.R" 
		- equivalent to above, but instead extract fossil calibrations from "tree_with_fossil_tips" according to low taxon sampling

10) "simulate_sequences.R"
	Requires as input the entire trees with branch lengths in units of n from either 4, 5, or 6.
	Outputs sequences relating to different levels of character sampling or different levels of taxon sampling

11) "r_shell.R" example script for integrating simulations in r.

12) "simple_clock_script.Rev" estimate divergence times with a strict molecular clock
	Requires as input the simulated trees from 4-6, and the simulated sequence data from 10.
	
13) "relaxed_script.Rev" estimate divergence times with a relaxed clock
	We used as input the simulated trees from 5, and corresponding simulated sequence data from 10.

14) "relaxed_script_with_node_calibrations.Rev" estimate divergence times with node calibrations and a relaxed clock.
	Input is simulated trees from 5, corrsponding simulated sequence data from 7, and relevent fossil information generated by 7 and 9.

15) "node_calibrations.Rev" estimate divergence times with node calibrations and a strict clock.
	Input is the simulated trees from 4, simulated sequence data from 10, and relevent fossil information generated by 7 and 8.

16) "yule.Rev" estimate constant rate diversification parameters in RevBayes sims with mu = 0.
	Required input is output from 4

17) "birth-death.Rev" estimate constant rate diversification parameters in RevBayes sims with mu > 0.
	Required input is output from 4

18) "episodic_birth.Rev" estimate diversification parameters with the assumption of a shift in lambda at time t.
	Required input is from 6

19) "episodic_death.Rev" estimate diversification parameters with the assumption of a shift in mu at time t.
	Required input is from 6
 
20) "rev_shell.Rev" example script for integrating simulations in revbayes.

21) "SIMULATION_STUDY_WITH_DIVERSIFICATION_SIMPLE.py" script for integrating simulations performaed in r, and analyses of simulated data performed in revbayes
	Especially useful for formatting outputs from 8 and 9 and preparing files for analysis in RevBayes.

###SCRIPTS_FOR_EMPIRICAL_ANALYSES###

22) "strict_ipo.Rev" divergence time estimation in Ipomoea with a strict clock. 

23) "relaxed_ipo.Rev" divergence time estimation in Ipomoea with a relaxed clock.

24) "yule_ipo.Rev" estimate diversification parameters in Ipomoea with assumption of constant parameters and mu = 0.

25) "birth_death_ipo.Rev" estimate diversification parameters in Ipomoea with assumption of constant parameters and mu > 0.

26) "branch_specific_spec.Rev" estimate branch specific diversification params in Ipomoea with assumption that mu = 0

27) "branch_specific_spec_ext.Rev" estimate branch specific diversification params in Ipomoea with assumption lambda and mu > 0 and both heterogeneous
